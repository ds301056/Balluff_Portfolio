### Real-World Industrial Automation Experience — Python, JavaScript, PLCs, and SCADA Systems

During my time at **Balluff**, I worked as a **Software Engineer** on the **TechDisplays** team — a small group dedicated to designing and building real-time demo systems that showcased Balluff’s **sensor and industrial automation technologies** to customers across North America.

---

## ⚙️ Overview

I developed a large-scale **mySCADA-based system** that integrated more than **120 sensors**, **8 Siemens PLCs**, multiple **Balluff vision cameras**, **RFID readers**, and **IO-Link master blocks** — all communicating across **Ethernet/IP**, **Profinet**, and **MQTT**.

The system provided **real-time monitoring**, **data visualization**, and **diagnostics**, and was deployed on a **local network server** accessible to both internal engineers and customers during live product demos.

## 💻 My Role & Responsibilities

- Designed and programmed the **data acquisition layer** using **Python** and **JavaScript** to communicate with PLCs and devices via **REST APIs**, **Ethernet/IP**, and **Profinet**.
- Built and styled **HTML/CSS/JS-based dashboards** to visualize live process data and diagnostics.
- Created custom **automation scripts** to fetch, parse, and display data from sensors in real time.
- Collaborated with engineers to simulate industrial applications for **14 demo stations (V1–V14)** as part of the **Balluff Van 2** project.
- Deployed and maintained the entire demo network locally, ensuring low latency and reliable communication between devices.
- Experimented with **custom-built SCADA alternatives**, showing how lightweight, Python-driven solutions could rival commercial platforms like Ignition.

## 🚀 Highlight Project: _Balluff Van 2 Demo System_

I built the software backbone for **14 interactive demo modules (V1–V14)**, each demonstrating a unique automation principle — from precision measurement to intelligent identification.  
This project became a **core showcase platform** for the marketing and sales team, helping customers understand the value of Balluff technology through **live, data-driven demonstrations**.

---

## 💡 Reflection

This project solidified my passion for **bridging industrial hardware and modern software** — using Python, JavaScript, and networking to make complex systems interactive, reliable, and visually intuitive.  
It also reinforced my belief that **custom-built, purpose-driven software** can often outperform expensive off-the-shelf automation solutions.

### 🧠 Key Takeaway

> “Automation doesn’t need to be complex — it just needs to be _intelligent_.”
