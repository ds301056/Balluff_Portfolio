# üè≠ Balluff Automation Portfolio

### Real-World Industrial Automation Experience ‚Äî Python, JavaScript, PLCs, and SCADA Systems

During my time at **Balluff**, I worked as a **Software Engineer** on the **TechDisplays** team ‚Äî a small group dedicated to designing and building real-time demo systems that showcased Balluff‚Äôs **sensor and industrial automation technologies** to customers across North America.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

I developed a large-scale **mySCADA-based system** that integrated more than **120 sensors**, **8 Siemens PLCs**, multiple **Balluff vision cameras**, **RFID readers**, and **IO-Link master blocks** ‚Äî all communicating across **Ethernet/IP**, **Profinet**, and **MQTT**.

The system provided **real-time monitoring**, **data visualization**, and **diagnostics**, and was deployed on a **local network server** accessible to both internal engineers and customers during live product demos.

## üíª My Role & Responsibilities

* Designed and programmed the **data acquisition layer** using **Python** and **JavaScript** to communicate with PLCs and devices via **REST APIs**, **Ethernet/IP**, and **Profinet**.
* Built and styled **HTML/CSS/JS-based dashboards** in **mySCADA**, providing real-time visualizations of process data and system diagnostics.
* Created custom **Python automation scripts** to fetch, process, and display live sensor data ‚Äî enabling real-time decision-making and system optimization.
* Collaborated with engineers to simulate industrial applications for **14 demo stations (V1‚ÄìV14)** as part of the **Balluff Van 2** project.
* Deployed and maintained the entire demo network locally, ensuring low latency and reliable communication between PLCs, IO-Link devices, and the SCADA server.
* Experimented with **custom lightweight SCADA alternatives**, demonstrating how **Python-driven** architectures can rival commercial platforms like Ignition.

## üîç Project Architecture

The **Balluff SCADA network** managed **12 interconnected modules**, each equipped with 10+ sensors for measuring critical parameters such as **temperature, flow rate, and pressure**.
Data was transmitted in real time through **Ethernet/IP** and **Profinet**, aggregated by **Siemens PLCs**, and visualized in **mySCADA dashboards** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

### Communication Overview

* **Ethernet/IP & Profinet** ‚Äî Real-time PLC-to-SCADA data exchange
* **MQTT** ‚Äî Efficient event-based communication between sensor clusters
* **REST API** ‚Äî Standardized integration for data retrieval and remote control

## üöÄ Highlight Project: *Balluff Van 2 Demo System*

I built the software backbone for **14 interactive demo modules (V1‚ÄìV14)**, each demonstrating a unique automation concept ‚Äî from **precision measurement** to **intelligent identification**.
The project became a **flagship marketing tool**, enabling live, data-driven demonstrations of Balluff‚Äôs sensor technologies and automation capabilities.

## üí° Reflection

This experience solidified my passion for **bridging industrial hardware and modern software** ‚Äî using Python, JavaScript, and networking to make complex systems interactive, reliable, and visually intuitive.
It also reinforced my belief that **custom-built, purpose-driven software** can often outperform expensive off-the-shelf automation solutions.

Would you like me to format this into a **Markdown file (`README.md`)** with proper headers, image sizing, and collapsible sections (so it looks polished on GitHub)?
I can generate that version next.
